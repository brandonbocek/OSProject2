The master.c will create shared memory and fork the children
while carefully doing that to make sure too many are not made.

The exec is called for each child where the child will go into
the slave.c code. In that file the child process will look at shared
memory, some variable in it as well as the Peterson or Bakery algo
to make sure it is alone in the critical section. Then the process
will take the right string from the array, check if its a palindrome
and write the string to one of the files. Then it will leave the 
critical section and the next process will do the same. This continues
until every string has been written to a file.
