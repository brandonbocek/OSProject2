What to do

1. type either "make" or "make all"
	This will compile the executables
	master for the master process
	and palin for all of the slaves
	when execl is called in master
2. type ./master
	This will read words from a text
	file called palin.in and all 
	palindromes will be written to
	palin.out while non-palindromes
	will be written to nopalin.out
3. Or type ./master -h
	You will be presented with
	command line arguments to change
	what file you want to read words
	from and/or changing the max_writes
	for the slave's for loop just outside
	the multiple process algorithm. You
	ca also change the termination time.
